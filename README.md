# parallel-prime-check

This repository contains 3 programs that calculate the amount of prime numbers between 1 and N, for 21 variations of N, where N changes using the function N = N * 2. The programs were writen in using the openmp, mpi and cuda libraries for the C language. The purpose of these programs is to show the gain of performance the more parallelism there is.
